    <h2> • Summary:</h2><br>
    <li><b>Project name:</b></Project> Pet shelter adoption - responsive design</li>
   <li><b>Project duration:</b> August-September 2022 </li>
   <li><b>My role:</b> It was my personal project so I was responsible for everything.</li> <br><br>


   <h2> • The product</h2><br>
    <p>Reksio dog shelter is a website where you can find your four pawed best friend. <br> No matter what type of dog you are looking for, we have them all just one click away. You can also foster or take the dog for a walk. </p><br><br>



    <h2>• The problem</h2><br>
<p>Available animal shelter websites have cluttered design and it’s not easy to search for a specific breed because most of them are laking search engine.</p>
    <br><br>
 
 
    <h2>• The goal</h2><br>
<p> Designing an user friendly dog shelter website with clear navigation and quick and efficient search engine.</p>
     <br><br>
   
       
<br> <br> 


        <h2>• User pain points:</h2><br><br>
        <p> Design:<br>
            Animal shelter websites are usually poorly designed.
             <br><br>
        Search engine:<br>
        The search process is not fast and efficient enough<br><br>
        Adoption process:<br>
        Adoption process is rather long and difficult to go through.</p>
               <br><br>

        
            <p> I conducted user interviews, which I then turned into empathy maps to better understand the target user and their needs. <br> I discovered that many target users are paying big attention to the design of a website. <br>The users getting often frustrated if the site is cluttered and when they are not able to find things on it. <br> They were also complaining on the adoption flow to not be clear and rather complicated. After those interviews, I created a persona and defined 3 main pain points.</p><br><br>

            <h2>• Problem statement</h2><br>
            <p>
                <img src="persona1.jpg"><br>
                Emma is an animal enthusiast who needs a good search engine on the shelter website <br> because she wants to find the animal who will be a perfect fit to her family.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>• User journey map and site map
    </h2><br>
    <p>I created a user journey map of Emma’s experience using the site to help identify possible pain points and improvement opportunities. <br> To view the map click <a href="journey1.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> <br>
        I decided to make the website as easy as possible with only three main categories. <br> My main focus was to make the navigation easy and quick as well as the adoption process to be clear for everyone.

       <h2>• Startig the design: </h2><br><br>
        <p>● Paper wireframes <br>
        ● Digital wireframes <br> 
        ● Low-fidelity prototype <br>
        ● Usability studies<br> </p>
        <br>


       <h2>• Paper wireframes </h2><br><br>
       <img src="wireframes1.png"><br>
        <p>Next, I sketched out paper wireframes for the two main screens on my website, keeping the user pain points <br> about the design, search engine and adoption process in mind.<br>
        Because people nowadays use all sorts of devices, <br> I started working on different screen version in order to make the website responsive.</p><br><br>

        <h2>• Digital wireframes </h2> <br><br>
           <p> <img src="digitalwireframes.png"><br>
            Moving from paper into digital wireframes made me realize what are the main things I want to focus on.<br> For me it was: a nice big hero image, large buttons and clear search engine.
            I have also wanted users to create their own accounts.
        <br><br>

        <h2>• Low Low-fidelity prototype</h2><br>
       <p> To create a low-fidelity prototype I connected all of the screens involved in the primary user flow <br> of searching for a dog and booking a walk.
        At this point I have received feedback from my friends <br> and other designers so I have decided to follow their suggestions and implement a few changes to the high-fidelity prototype.</p> <br><br>


       <h2> • Usability study: findings </h2><br><br>


<p>1. Search engine<br>
    The search engine was showing all available dogs, not a specific breed or age.<br><br>
2. Calendar <br> 
User wanted to be able to book a walk with the dog more than once.<br> <br>
3. Favorites <br> 
Users were loving the “add to favorites” option<br> <br> 
</p>


 <br><br> 
    
<h2>• Mockups</h2><br>
<p>Based on the insights from the usability study, I made changes to improve the search engine. <br> I have added “popular filter” option to help users narrow down they search to a specific breed or age.<br>  I also decided to make the “add to favorites” option to be easily noticeable.<br>  I put white hearts next to every dog picture - once an user clicked on the heart, the dog was automatically added to his cart.<br>

<h2>• Accessibility considerations</h2> <br><br>
<p>1. I used headings with different sized text for clear visual hierarchy. <br>
2. I used large buttons and I added filters that helps the users find what they are looking for faster. <br>
3.The design colors are accessible for colour-blind users  </p><br><br> 


<h2>• Takeaways</h2><br><br> 
<p>Impact:<br> <br>
    Our target users shared that the design was intuitive to navigate through,<br> more engaging with the images and demonstrated a clear visual hierarchy. </p> <br><br>



<h2>• What I learned: </h2> <br> 
    <p>I learned that even a small design change can have a big impact on the user experience.<br> The most important takeaway for me is to always focus on the user needs, not on what I think would look good.</p><br><br>
