    <h1>EmpatheticLink: <br>
        Bridging Connections for Introverts
    </h1><br><br><br>

    <h2>Project Overview:</h2><br><br>
     EmpatheticLink is a mobile application designed to provide introverted individuals with a platform to connect with extroverted helpers who can assist them in booking appointments, making reservations, and engaging in various social interactions.<br><br> 
    <h2>My Roles and Responsibilities:</h2><br><br>
<b>UX Researcher:</b> Conducted user interviews, surveys, and usability tests.<br>

<b>UI Designer: </b>Crafted the app's visual elements and style guide.<br>
<b>Front-end Developer:</b> Implemented the design and collaborated on usability improvements.<br><br>

<h2>Problem statement:</h2><br><br>
Introverts struggle with arranging appointments and social engagements, often experiencing anxiety when making phone calls or seeking help from extroverted friends, resulting in missed opportunities and heightened stress levels.<br><br>

<h2>Solution:</h2><br><br>
