    <h2>• Summary:</h2><br>
    <li><b>Project name:</b></Project> App appintment calendar for a cafe in Vienna</li>
   <li><b>Project duration:</b> May-July 2022 </li>
   <li><b>My role:</b> It was my personal project so I was responsible for everything.</li> <br><br>


   <h2>• Challenge</h2><br>
   <p>I wanted to create an app for both native and foreigners who are visiting Vienna. <br> My goal was to make the whole experience of booking a table as pleasant and as easy as possible. <br> I wanted to understand what kind of challenges users might face and give them the best user experience possible. </p><br><br>



    <h2>• The problem</h2><br>
    <p>Foreigners had problems with booking the table in a language other than English. <br> Some people with disabilities couldn’t see the letters on the apps and there weren’t the voice control option available.</p>
    <br><br>
 
 
    <h2>• The goal</h2><br>
<p>Designing an app that is easy to use for both people with disabilities and people from different countries.</p>
     <br><br>
   


       
<br> <br> 


        <h2>• User pain points:</h2><br><br>
        <p> Accessibility:<br>
           Foreigners have difficulties to book a table if they don’t speak the local language.<br><br>
        Process:<br>
        The checking process on booking platforms is usually too complicated to follow.<br><br>
        IA:<br>
        Text is usually too small to read especially for people with vision problems.</p>
               <br><br>

        <p>I have conducted a <b>competitive audit</b> where my goal was to compare "booking a table" experience of each competitor's app.<br> My key competitors were Cafe Central, a very famous cafe place in Vienna and two indirect competitors <br> - Skybar Steffl and Italian restaurant also from the same city. I found some strengths and weaknesses in each of the competitors. <br> The main takaways from the whole audid are : <b>in order to be really competitive, cafe's need to provide audio <br>feature and images in the menu and at least 2 language version</b><br><br>
        The whole competitive audid is available to read over <a href="audit.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Journey map and close-up story board are avaliable <a href="journey.png" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="story.png" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br><br> 


        
    
    
       <h2>• Startig the design: </h2><br>
        <p>● Paper wireframes <br>
        ● Digital wireframes <br> 
        ● Low-fidelity prototype <br>
        ● Usability studies<br> </p>
        <br>


       <h2> • Paper wireframes </h2><br><br>
       <img src="paper.png"><br>
        <p>I was trying to figure out what would make the whole process of booking a table easy and quick.<br> I’ve had a few ideas, eventually I have decided to go with the one that has an option to switch the language and has the voice assistant button included.</p><br><br>

        <h2>• Digital wireframes </h2> <br><br>
           <p> <img src="digital1.png"><br>
        As the initial design phase continued, I made sure to base screen designs on feedback and findings from the user research. <br>Click <a href="digital2.png" target="_blank">here</a> to see more of my digital wireframes.
        <br><br>

        <h2>• Low Low-fidelity prototype</h2><br>
        <p>Using the completed set of digital wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype.<br> The primary user flow I connected was to book a table, so the prototype could be used in a usability study.</p> <br><br>
       <img src="prototype1.png"> <br><br>


       <h2> • Usability study: findings </h2><br><br>
<p>I conducted two rounds of usability studies. Findings from the first study helped guide the designs from wireframes to mockups. <br> The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed refining.</p> <br><br>

<b>Round 1 findings:</b> <br>
1. User want an easy and fast booking process<br>
2. User wants to be able understand the language<br> 
3. Users want more customization options <br> <br> 


<b>Round 2 findings: </b><br>
1. The checkout process was not clear enough <br> 
2. The voice access button was placed in the wrong area <br> 
3. The calendar could have been more clear <br>    <br> <br> 


More detailed usability study is avaliable <a href="research.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br> 
    
<h2>• Mockups</h2><br>
<p>Early designs allowed for some customization, 
but after the usability studies, I have decided to change the calendar so <br>now the user can clearly see what day of the week his booking occurs on. <br>I have also moved the voice access button and the „change language” button a bit lower and made them bigger so the users can spot them right <br>away. Furthermore, I have used colors that are high in contrast to make the whole design even more accessible. <br>The final high-fidelity prototype presented cleaner user flows for booking a table at Vienna Cafe. <br>It also met user needs for including days of the week in the calendar as well as language switch and the voice access icon. <br><br>

You can find the prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vLv8qkzffEzkwuKMUrFPO4/FIRST-PROJECT?node-id=1%3A17&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A4" target="_blank">here</a>. </p> <br> <br> 

<h2>• Accessibility considerations</h2> <br><br>
<p>1. Provided access to users who are vision impaired through using bigger font size and adding the voice access button. <br>
2. Making sure that the colors of the buttons and background as well as the<br> text are in the right contrast for the user to have the best possible experience. <br>
3. Making the checkout process very smooth and simple to follow. Adding the days of the week into <br>the calendar to make it even easier for the users to book the right date. </p><br><br> 


<h2>• Takeaways</h2><br><br> 
<p>Impact:<br> 
The app makes users feel like Vienna Cafe really thinks about how to meet their needs.<br>
One quote from peer feedback:<br>
<i>“The app made it so easy to book a table. Before I was hesitant to use this type of apps in a non English speaking country because <br>I thought they would be only providing their service in a local language, but using this one I can switch between 4 different languages!” </i> </p> <br><br>



<h2>• What I learned: </h2> <br> 
    <p>It was my very first project. While designing the booking table app, I learned that the first ideas <br> for the app are only the beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration of the app's designs.</p><br><br>
